## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwindcss
- Vanilla Js


### What I learned

I improved my skills with css flex and grid property and the use of tailwindcss while also putting my js skills to practice. 

### Continued development

I will want to learn and know more about Javascript DOM manipulation.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind doc](https://www.tailwindcss/docs.com) - It is my most used resource. I only used others when a concept is confusing.
